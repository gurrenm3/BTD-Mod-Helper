# 3.0 New Features Overview

### Revamp of Mod Settings into a full **Mods Menu**
- New Mods button in the bottom right of the Menu screen, showing total mods and an indicator for mod updates
- Mods Menu lists currently installed Mods. Mods can include Icon, Description, Homepage etc
- Simple enabling and disabling mods from In Game (still requiring restart for now)
- An individual and customizable Mod Settings menu for each mod, with more setting variants like Hotkeys, Categories, File/Folder Picking, etc
- A **Mod Browser** that lets you download Mods from public GitHub repositories
- Updating mods from within the Menu, seeing release notes
- All designed with a [new UI system](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Custom-UI,-Menus) that modders can use as well to more easily make polished UIs using NK's own graphics

### [Custom Bloons](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Making-a-Custom-Bloon)
- Automatically appear in the Sandbox menu
- Use custom 2d or 3d visuals
- Easily addable to non-sandbox matches via...

### [Custom Round Sets](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Making-a-Custom-Round-Set)
- Define a custom set of rounds, with any max number
- Customizable hint popups
- Accessible using a new (toggleable) "Round Set Changer" on the Map Select screen that will let you play any game mode with any Round Set

### [Custom Game Modes](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Making-a-Custom-Game-Mode)
- A new button added to the Easy, Medium or Hard map difficulty screen
- Use a default or custom roundset
- Add any special rules you want

### Standardized Mod Sources Folder for Mod Creators
- In the Mod Helper Settings, you can choose a folder on your computer as your "Mod Sources" folder
- The Mod Helper will keep an updated "btd6.targets" file in that folder that your Mod projects can import to automatically:
  - Get all the correct Melonloader and BTD6 dependencies
  - Include all .png/.bundle files in your project as embedded resources
  - Copy your dll file to the Mods folder on build
- Any mod utilizing "btd6.targets" could be downloaded by anyone into their own Mod Sources folder and have all of the above features automatically, regardless of either modders' BTD6 install location
- There's also an In Game screen where you can create a new empty Mod project in your Mod Sources folder, or upgrade a mod project that's already in there to use the new .csproj format

### Other
- A new [loading system](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Custom-Load-Tasks) for mods, allowing long tasks to be added to the games own initial start up tasks
- Internal improvements to resource loading, reducing lag from loading in custom images and models
- A standardized way to use the same [byte loading](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Custom-Byte-Loaders) strategy as Ultimate Crosspathing
- Full, automatically generated [documentation](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/blob/3.0_Features/Documentation/README.md#bloonstd6-mod-helper-assembly) for all Mod Helper classes, API methods and extensions
- Patches for `BloonsMod` melons will now be try-catched by default, meaning one patch failing after a BTD6 update won't break your whole mod
- Custom outline colors for your ModDisplays!

### Obsolete Things
- The old methods of Mod auto updating.
- The keycode hooks are no longer active, as they have too much overhead when you can now just use a ModSettingHotkey
- Certain previous properties of ModSettings that weren't widely used
