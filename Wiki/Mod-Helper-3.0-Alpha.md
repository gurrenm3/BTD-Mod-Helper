### The new Mod Helper 3.0 update has been in the works for a while, and it is the version that has Tower / Display fixes for BTD6 v32. It's nearly ready for release, but it relies on a couple of features from the MelonLoader 0.5.5 update that is also coming soon but hasn't widely released just yet.

## How to use the Mod Helper 3.0

1. Download and install a [MelonLoader alpha build from their Github Actions](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/actions/runs/2806436995).
    - You'll just need to scroll down to the artifacts section and download the appropriate one, most likely [MelonLoader.x64.CI.Release](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/suites/7690694577/artifacts/321208644). 
    - Then simply unzip it and drop the MelonLoader folder and version.dll into your BloonsTD6 folder, replacing files if it asks.
2. Download the latest Mod Helper 3.0 Alpha version. You can get the absolutely latest version from [our own GitHub Actions](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/actions), or see the doombubbles forked repo using 3.0 as the main branch for [named Alpha releases](https://github.com/doombubbles/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases) that will also appear in the Mods Menu.
    - The .dll file has been renamed (no more spaces, so can be sent more easily!) so make sure to delete the old Mod Helper .dll

### For the full list of update features see [3.0 Update Overview](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/3.0-Update-Overview)

### For even more specific information about getting Mods to be visible in the Mod Browser, see [3.0 Appearing in the Mod Browser](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Appearing-in-the-Mod-Browser-%28ModHelperData%29)

## As this is still an alpha, things may still not be fully stable, and helpers within the BTD6 modding and MelonLoader communities may not be equipped to help with every problem you encounter.
